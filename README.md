# Fierr
Replace your error page with a more stylish appearance with additional features.

#### Supports
 * Firefox [1.5 - 50.*]

## Building
Simply download the contents of the repository and pack the contents (sans git data) into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
You can grab the latest release from the [Official Web Site](//realityripple.com/Software/Mozilla-Extensions/Fierr/).

## Customization
Due to the security restrictions on the network error file, adding things like settings and options is impossible through normal means. Instead, you may create a [custom version](//realityripple.com/Software/Mozilla-Extensions/Fierr/customized.php) of the extension with your own personalized background image, icons, and element positioning. For more advanced changes, such as choosing a different search engine or adjusting the countdown time, you'll have to edit the source code yourself.
